1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,384
What if you wanted to make the first paragraph bold,

2
00:00:03,384 --> 00:00:04,859
with a larger font,

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,445
and then the last two paragraphs with an italic font.

4
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:12,945
To change the font and font style, you'll need CSS.

5
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:17,695
But we're not quite ready yet to add CSS styling.

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:22,199
You'll need to differentiate between the first paragraph and the other paragraphs.

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,579
HTML has attributes specifically for differentiating elements from each other,

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,889
the ID attribute and the class attribute.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,460
IDs uniquely identify a piece of content.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,664
For example, I can use an ID in the first paragraph to add ID equals P top.

11
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:44,729
As you'll see later in this lesson,

12
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,984
you can now pick out the P top paragraph and add a bold font just to that paragraph.

13
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:56,149
An ID is a unique identifier that you should only use once per HTML page.

14
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,504
You can name IDs whatever you want,

15
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:00,830
but you should only use the name once,

16
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,390
and the tag should only have one ID.

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,689
So, the paragraph tag can only have that P Top ID.

18
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:11,929
I'll add a few other IDs to reinforce this.

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,480
So, for example, the middle paragraph can be P middle,

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,710
and the bottom P bottom.

21
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:22,164
I'm going to add IDs to the div tags as well.

22
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:27,405
Like ID equals link section and ID equals paragraph section.

23
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:30,680
Like I said, IDs can go in any tag.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,740
Each element can have one ID,

25
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:36,155
and each ID name should be unique.

26
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:41,995
The idea is that you're separating out the content for different CSS styling.

27
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:44,189
Classes on the other hand,

28
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,209
group multiple pieces of content together.

29
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:53,129
So, for example I could add a class to these two bottom paragraphs called italic text.

30
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:58,349
Implying that I'm going to style these two paragraphs with an italic font.

31
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:00,799
You can name a class whatever you want,

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,319
and you can use a class name multiple times in

33
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,864
an HTML document in order to group pieces of content together.

34
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:11,335
An element can even have more than one class.

35
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:14,490
Like I could add another class called green text.

36
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,390
Implying I'm going to style this last paragraph green.

37
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:21,500
I could have the same green text class to a link.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,620
Adding IDs and classes will give you more control over your website's CSS styling,

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,045
they help you add style to your pages in a logical organized way.

40
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:33,769
In the next exercise,

41
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,594
you'll get practice adding div and span tags,

42
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:39,199
as well as using classes and IDs.
