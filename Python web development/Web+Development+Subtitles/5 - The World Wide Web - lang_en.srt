1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
In the major web browsers like Firefox or Chrome,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,570
you can actually see the messages and files

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,290
getting transmitted between you and the server.

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,649
In Chrome, go to the View menu,

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,294
then select Developer, and Developer tools.

6
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:17,024
That's what I have open here.

7
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:22,250
Then click up here on the Network tab and visit a website.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,259
I'm going to visit the Udacity homepage.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,585
So, these are all the files that your browser requests when going to a web page.

10
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:34,454
If you click on a file, for example, here,

11
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:37,295
you'll see Request Method: GET,

12
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,130
which is your browser saying,

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,290
"Get me this file or information from the server."

14
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:45,019
The reason I'm showing you all of this is so that you can

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,060
physically see how the web actually works and what is going on.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,410
As you practice coding with Flask,

17
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,109
it can be helpful to understand the basics of how

18
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,670
the Internet works between a browser and a server.
